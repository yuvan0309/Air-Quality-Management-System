    "# Physics-Based Derivation of Air Pressure\n",
    "\n",
    "This document outlines a theoretical derivation of air pressure considering temperature, humidity, and (to a very limited extent) particulate matter. The derivation is based on the ideal gas law and the concept of partial pressures in a mixture of gases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. The Ideal Gas Law\n",
    "\n",
    "For a gas (or a mixture of gases), the ideal gas law is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P = ρ.R.T $$\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- P is the pressure,\n",
    "- ρ is the density of the gas,\n",
    "- R is the specific gas constant,\n",
    "- T is the absolute temperature (in Kelvin).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Partial Pressures in Air\n",
    "\n",
    "Air is a mixture of dry air and water vapor. According to Dalton's law of partial pressures, the total pressure \\(P\\) is the sum of the partial pressures of the components:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P = P_d + e $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- P_d is the partial pressure of dry air,\n",
    "- e is the partial pressure of water vapor.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Partial Pressure of Dry Air\n",
    "\n",
    "For dry air, using the ideal gas law:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P_d = ρ_d , R_d , T $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- ρ_d is the density of dry air,\n",
    "- R_d is the specific gas constant for dry air (approximately 287 J/(kg·K)).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Partial Pressure of Water Vapor\n",
    "\n",
    "The water vapor pressure (e) can be related to the relative humidity (RH) and the saturation vapor pressure (e_s(T)):\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ e = (RH/100) . e_s(T) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A common empirical formula for the saturation vapor pressure (with temperature (T) in °C) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ e_s(T) ~= 6.11 x 10^((7.5T)/(273.3+T)) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** For the ideal gas law, temperature must be in Kelvin.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Density of Water Vapor\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the ideal gas law for water vapor, its density (ρ_v) is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ ρ_v = e/(R_v . T) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- ρ_v is the water vapor density (kg/m³),\n",
    "- e is the water vapor pressure (Pa),\n",
    "- (R_v) is the specific gas constant for water vapor (approximately 461 J/(kg·K)),\n",
    "- T is the absolute temperature (K).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Inclusion of Particulate Matter (PM)\n",
    "\n",
    "Particulate matter (PM) is usually measured in mass concentration (e.g., µg/m³). Although PM contributes additional mass to the air, its effect on pressure is generally negligible due to:\n",
    "- Its small mass fraction relative to air,\n",
    "- Its non-gaseous behavior (i.e., it does not exert pressure via molecular collisions like gases).\n",
    "\n",
    "If one wishes to include the effect of PM in a very simplified manner, the total density can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ ρ_total = ρ_d + ρ_v + ρ_pm $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where: \n",
    "- ρ_total is the total air density (kg/m³),\n",
    "- ρ_d is the dry air density (kg/m³),\n",
    "- ρ_v is the water vapor density (kg/m³),\n",
    "- ρ_pm is the particulate matter density (kg/m³).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the pressure could be approximated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P_total = ρ_total x R_m x T $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where R_m is an effective gas constant for the mixture. In practice, since ρ_pm is many orders of magnitude smaller than ρ_d and ρ_v, its impact on the total pressure is minimal.\n",
    "\n",

    "# Hydrostatic Balance PDE for Pressure with Temperature, Humidity, and Particulate Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "In a static atmosphere, the **hydrostatic equilibrium** is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ ∂P/∂z = -ρ×g $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where  \n",
    "- P(x,y,z) is the atmospheric pressure,  \n",
    "- ρ(x,y,z) is the air density,  \n",
    "- g is the gravitational acceleration, and  \n",
    "- z is the vertical coordinate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Decomposing Air Density\n",
    "\n",
    "Air is a mixture of dry air, water vapor, and (to a very small extent) particulate matter. We write the total density as\n",

    "- P_d is the partial pressure of dry air,  \n",
    "- R_d ≈ 287 J/(kg·K)is the specific gas constant for dry air, and  \n",
    "- T is the absolute temperature (in Kelvin).\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the total pressure is the sum of the dry air and water vapor partial pressures,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P = P_d + e $$\n",
    "\n",
    "we can write\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ ρ_d = (P-e)/(R_d x T). $$\n",

    "\n",
    "$$ ρ_v = (e)/(R_v x T), $$\n",

    "$$ e_s(T) ≈ 6.11 x 10^((7.5T)/(273.3+T)) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3 Particulate Matter (PM)\n",
    "\n",
    "The particulate matter mass density \\(\\rho_{pm}\\) is usually very small compared to ρ_d and ρ_v. In many cases its effect on the overall pressure can be neglected. However, for completeness, we include it:\n",

    "- **Hydrostatic Approximation:**  \n",
